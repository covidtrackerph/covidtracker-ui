# COVID Tracker Philippines

[![Build status](https://dev.azure.com/clarinojd/Covid-19%20Tracker/_apis/build/status/COVID%20Tracker%20PROD)](https://dev.azure.com/clarinojd/Covid-19%20Tracker/_build/latest?definitionId=7)


This project is meant as a lightweight mobile friendly alternative to the official [DOH NCov Tracker](https://ncovtracker.doh.gov.ph/). It aims to provide a better user experience to the Filipino community as a whole amidst this Pandemic.

This application currently supports tracking for the Philippines only. Rest assured we are working on a solution that would cater a glocal scale.

If you are from the **United States**, my colleague [@vdurano](https://github.com/proudmonkey) has a tracker for **Minnesota** which can be found here [NCov tracker MN]( http://trackncov.vmsdurano.com/)
